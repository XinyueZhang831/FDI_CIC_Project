# FDI CIC Projecr

Extract yearly FDI catalog from pdf to csv file, and clean csv file to be used for next step. Some of catalogs are copied and pasted from original website to excel, so there is no extract code, only clean code.

## Code
Each year related code has been saved in the save folder.
Include:

- Extract_yyy.py
- Clean_yyyy.py
- find_all_parenthesis.py

## Catalog Year
- 1995
- 1997
- 2002
- 2004
- 2007

## PDF Extractor
